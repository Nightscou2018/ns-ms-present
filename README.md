## presentation

A presentation quickly hacked together.
Downloaded bunch of photos, got them to lexically sort by filename,
and generate a new slide for each one.

Basically, `pandoc` renders a markdown file into a reveal.js
presentation.  While there are all kinds of features for influencing
slides, I ran out of time and had to suffice with a simple list.
Maybe slides that just go from left to right are just fine.
